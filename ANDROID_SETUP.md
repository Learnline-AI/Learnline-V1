# Android App Setup Guide

## Complete Android Application Built

I've created a full-featured Android application that mirrors your web app functionality with native mobile capabilities.

### What's Been Built

**Application Structure:**
```
mobile-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/        # UI components (ChatBubble, VoiceButton, BottomNavigation)
│   ├── hooks/            # Audio hooks (useAudioRecording, useAudioPlayback)
│   ├── screens/          # Main screens (ChatScreen, SettingsScreen, ProfileScreen)
│   ├── services/         # API service (connects to your existing backend)
│   └── types/            # TypeScript definitions (copied from web app)
├── App.tsx               # Main app with tab navigation
├── app.json              # Expo configuration with Android permissions
├── package.json          # Dependencies configured
└── install-deps.sh       # Dependency installation script
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Voice-based conversation with push-to-talk recording
- Real-time audio playback with controls
- Hindi/English multilingual interface
- Settings screen for language/voice preferences
- Profile screen with learning statistics
- Bottom tab navigation
- Android-specific audio permissions
- Connection to your existing Express backend

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   chmod +x install-deps.sh
   ./install-deps.sh
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run on Android:**
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

### Backend Connection

The app connects to your existing Express server running on port 5000. No changes needed to your current backend - all APIs work identically.

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `/api/ask-teacher-stream` - Streaming AI responses
- `/api/audio-chunk/:chunkId` - Audio chunk retrieval  
- `/api/tts` - Text-to-speech conversion

### Android-Specific Enhancements

**Native Audio Capabilities:**
- Superior voice recording quality using Expo AV
- Background audio processing
- Native Android audio permissions
- Offline audio caching capability

**Mobile-Optimized UI:**
- Touch-friendly interface design
- Android navigation patterns
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Native Android styling

### Distribution

**For Testing:**
- Direct APK installation on Android devices
- USB debugging for development
- Internal testing via APK sharing

**For Production:**
- Google Play Store deployment
- Automated builds with `expo build:android`
- One-time $25 Google Play developer fee

### Key Differences from Web Version

**Enhanced Features:**
- Native push-to-talk with better audio quality
- Background audio processing
- Offline conversation caching
- Android-specific UI optimizations

**Same Backend:**
- Identical API calls to your Express server
- Same AI responses and TTS functionality
- No server-side changes required

The Android app is ready for immediate testing once dependencies are installed. It provides the same conversational AI tutoring experience as your web version but with native mobile capabilities optimized for voice interaction.
