# Learnline AI Tutor

## Overview

Learnline AI Tutor is a voice-based conversational AI application designed for Class 9 Science NCERT curriculum learning. The system provides an interactive tutoring experience through voice input/output with support for Hindi, English, and Hinglish languages. The application features an AI tutor persona "Ravi Bhaiya" that provides personalized learning experiences through natural conversation.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with separate client and server components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for fast development
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Mobile-First Design**: Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile devices
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for real-time voice recording and playback

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API (primary) with Claude fallback
- **TTS Integration**: Google Cloud TTS Chirp3 HD (primary) with ElevenLabs fallback
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for audio format conversion and optimization
- **Session Management**: In-memory session storage with cleanup mechanisms
- **Service Architecture**: Abstracted AI and TTS providers with configuration-based switching

## Key Components

### Voice Processing Pipeline
- **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API for voice-to-text conversion
- **Text-to-Speech**: Dual provider system (Google TTS primary, ElevenLabs fallback)
- **Audio Streaming**: Real-time audio chunk processing with queue management
- **Language Detection**: Automatic Hindi/English language detection
- **Voice Quality**: Google Chirp3 HD Neural2-A voice for superior Hindi pronunciation

### AI Conversation System
- **Streaming Responses**: Server-sent events for real-time text streaming
- **Parallel TTS**: Simultaneous text generation and audio synthesis
- **Context Management**: Session-based conversation context preservation
- **Smart Chunking**: Intelligent text segmentation for optimal audio playback
- **Provider Architecture**: Abstracted AI and TTS services with automatic fallbacks
- **High Performance**: Gemini 2.0 Flash + Google TTS for optimal India performance

### Mobile Application (React Native/Expo)

- **Native Audio**: Expo AV for enhanced mobile audio capabilities
- **Push-to-Talk**: Mobile-optimized voice recording interface
- **Offline Capabilities**: Basic offline functionality for core features

## Data Flow

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks into microphone ‚Üí Web Speech API converts to text
2. **AI Processing**: Text sent to Anthropic Claude ‚Üí Streaming response generated
3. **Audio Generation**: Response chunks sent to TTS providers ‚Üí Audio URLs returned
4. **Playback**: Audio streamed to client ‚Üí Sequential playback with queue management
5. **Session Management**: Conversation context maintained ‚Üí Automatic cleanup after inactivity

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Primary conversational AI (2-3x faster than Claude)
- **Google Cloud TTS**: High-quality text-to-speech with Chirp3 HD Neural2-A Hindi voice
- **Anthropic Claude**: Fallback conversational AI (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **ElevenLabs**: Fallback text-to-speech (Bella/Lily voices)

### Audio Processing
- **FFmpeg**: Audio format conversion and optimization
- **Web Audio API**: Client-side audio recording and playback
- **Expo AV**: Mobile audio capabilities

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast frontend build tool with HMR
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database schema management (PostgreSQL ready)
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Hosting
- **Primary Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite production build with Express static serving
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management through Replit Secrets
- **Port Configuration**: Multi-port setup (5000 main, 8081/8082 development)

### Database Strategy
- **Current**: In-memory storage for development/testing
- **Future**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (schema defined, ready for migration)
- **Session Storage**: Memory-based with configurable cleanup

### Mobile Deployment
- **Development**: Expo Go for rapid testing
- **Production**: EAS Build for standalone APK generation
- **Distribution**: Direct APK download or app store deployment
